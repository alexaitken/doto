Feature: List todo items
  In order to see everything I need to do 
  As a busy person
  I want I want to see all of my todo items in one place

  Scenario: empty todo list
    Given there are no todo items
    When I am on the todos page
    Then the todo list should have the message "You're all done!"
    And I should not see "Todo list"
